The Technology & Innovation Roadmap (TIR) is a sector-wide plan by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) to promote innovation, technology adoption and development in Singaporeâ€™s legal industry up to 2030. It identifies technologies that will impact and change legal services, and explores ways to support development and adoption of such technologies. The roadmap is the result of a series of four inter-connected workshops conducted between April to October 2019, facilitated by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), and brought together participants from across the legal industry and adjacent industries and disciplines to answer four key questions. <br>
