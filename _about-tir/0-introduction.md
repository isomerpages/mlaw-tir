#### The Technology & Innovation Roadmap (TIR) is a sector-wide plan by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) to promote innovation, technology adoption and development in Singapore’s legal industry up to 2030. It identifies technologies that will impact and change legal services, and explores ways to support development and adoption of such technologies.

# The Pressing Need for Transformation <br>
The legal industry is a key part of Singapore’s economy. It generated S$2.4B in nominal gross value add and employed more than 13,000 professionals in 2019. While the industry has endured for many decades, numerous challenges once on the horizon are now at its doorstep. On top of a global pandemic, there is disruption from artificial intelligence, blockchain, multi-disciplinary professional services networks and NewLaw entrants to the legal industry. These trigger changing customer behaviour, rising cost pressures and new demands of value, speed and flexibility from the industry. Against this backdrop, many firms have long recognised the need for action.

> **2018 LawSoc Survey**<br>
85% agreed that LegalTech is crucial to the development of the profession and sector <br>
70% agreed that there was a need to increase the level of LegalTech adoption in their firms <br>

# Supporting the Legal Industry<br>
Transformation is no longer radical, but essential. However, the transformation journey is not easy. There are challenges in adopting technology, such as the lack of resources to identify and implement suitable LegalTech solutions. This Legal Industry Technology & Innovation Roadmap (TIR) is here to help. It presents workshopped initiatives and recommendations, to support legal teams, both in-house and in private practice, in their transformation journeys. More importantly, to help those who are willing to keep an open mind and explore their options to spot and seize opportunities through transformation, to thrive in this new environment.
