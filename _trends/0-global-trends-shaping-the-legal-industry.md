## These were the five key global trends participants expected to have the most impact on the Singapore legal industry from now to 2030.

# Rise of Technology Giants
Today, seven of the top ten firms globally by market capitalisation are technology firms. They continue to grow not just in size but also in reach. They have disrupted industries from transportation and F&B, to retail and hospitality. The legal industry is not immune.

**OPPORTUNITY IN CRISIS** <br>
The growth of technology firms has accelerated during the global pandemic, with a surge in demand for certain technology services, such as online entertainment, e-commerce, remote collaboration, video-conferencing and cybersecurity services. 
<br>

**TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT** <br>
As technology giants become more prominent, and technology rapidly reshapes the way business is conducted, new complex legal issues (e.g. pertaining to privacy, ethics, competition, employment) will arise, creating new sources of demand for legal services.
<br>

# Trade Wars

Continued political uncertainty between the U.S. and China has not only affected economic growth but will change the global norms for international businesses. This in turn, will shape the legal norms that facilitate business transactions between these superpowers and their allies.

**NEW CYBERSECURITY CONCERNS** <br>
Countries may increasingly opt to use technology developed domestically or in allied nations.
<br>

**CHINA’S GROWING INFLUENCE** <br>
In line with their economic growth, China has established new international organisations and initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt & Road Initiative.
<br>

# Rise of Asia
Asia now accounts for more than half the world’s Gross Domestic Product by Purchasing Power Parity. With a growing middle class, the rising demand for goods and services in and from Asia signals new growth opportunities for businesses and hence, law firms in the region.

**MORE MNCs PIVOTING TOWARDS ASIA** <br>
Rise of Asia E.g. Dyson’s plans to relocate their HQ from the U.K. to Singapore.
<br>

**ASIAN FIRMS EMERGING AS MARKET LEADERS** <br>
E.g. Haier, a Chinese electronics manufacturer, has overtaken General Electric to become the world’s largest “white goods” manufacturer.
<br>

# COVID-19 Outbreak

The pandemic has disrupted industries and businesses globally. In heavily affected sectors, major shifts may result in more contractual and policy changes, debt restructuring, and acquisitions and mergers, all of which require legal services.

**OPERATIONAL PRESSURE** <br>
Business practices will change, and remote working arrangements may become the new norm. This has forced the hand of law firms, legal departments, and other relevant stakeholders to increasingly consider digitalisation and the role it plays in the provision of legal services.
<br>

# Increasing Legal Industry Competition

New entrants like multi-disciplinary practices are competing with traditional law firms by offering a range of professional services such as accounting and consultancy along with legal services. There are also service providers utilising digital tools to automate and provide on-demand legal services and operations.

**WIDENING REACH OF NON-TRADITIONAL LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS** <br>
Today, the Big Four professional services firms collectively boast around 10,000 lawyers globally. One of them, PwC, would be the sixth largest law firm in the world by lawyer count. With increased scale, the Big Four are able to offer a wider range of legal services across many jurisdictions.
<br>

**HIGH-VOLUME SERVICES** <br>
Legal process outsourcing firms like Consilio and DTI perform rote legal work such as drafting letters and conducting due diligence in bulk.
<br>

**DIGITAL SERVICE DELIVERY** <br>
NewLaw firms such as Axiom and Rocket Lawyer deliver their services digitally.
<br>

**MANAGED SERVICES** <br>
Firms like Thomson Reuters Legal Managed Services handle legal operations on behalf of their clients.
