> Based on the global trends identified, these were the expected changes in business demand for legal services.

# Increased Cybersecurity Demand <br>
**COSTLY CYBERATTACKS** <br>
As global tensions rise, so have cybersecurity threats. These fallouts are costly, with an estimated £11M in client money stolen from U.K. law firms in 2017 alone3. Law firms must now assure clients that their sensitive data can be well-protected. <br>
**GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES** <br>
Law firms like DLA Piper, Norton Rose Fulbright and Rajah & Tann already have a foot in this fast-growing market by looking to provide cybersecurity solutions. <br>
**US$173B**<br>
Market value of the cybersecurity market in 2020. It is set to grow 7.2% annually over the next six years.

> “If legal departments are to keep using law firms, they must step up their cybersecurity measures.” - Loretta Yuen, General Counsel, OCBC

# Increased Asian Demand for Legal Services <br>

**NATIVE TONGUE** <br>
As Asian companies flourish, they will expect legal service providers to be proficient in their native language, local laws, and business customs. <br>
**USE OF ASIAN LAWS** <br>
As intra-Asian investments increase and Asian laws mature, investors may prefer using regional laws rather than English law, which has seen its market share in Asia decline steadily over the years. <br>
**SOFTER APPROACHES** <br>
Relationship-focused Asian businesses may increasingly eschew litigation in favour of alternative dispute resolution methods like arbitration or mediation for commercial disputes, such as for China’s Belt & Road investment agreements. <br>

# Demand for 24/7 Accessibility <br>
**ALWAYS-ON CULTURE** <br>
The rise of technology giants and impact of a global pandemic have reshaped consumer behaviour. Clients expect on-demand legal services that can be accessed anytime, anywhere. <br>

**ADAPTING INTELLIGENTLY** <br>
While global law firms can meet round-theclock demands through their international network of offices, smaller regional firms with manpower constraints must seek innovative methods. They stand to benefit most from tech-driven solutions. <br>

> “Legal departments are already choosing tech solutions over external providers. The in-house counsel’s job is changing. They now also do what was previously done by external counsel.” - Tan Zhifeng, Senior Associate, Allen & Gledhill LLP

# Increase in Legal In-Sourcing <br>
**RISE OF IN-HOUSE**<br>
Technology giants who require niche legal expertise have found it more efficient to develop in-house legal capabilities than to outsource. Some in-house legal departments are now larger than the biggest Singapore Law Practices (SLPs) and function almost as law firms in their own right. <br>

49% of clients insourced at least ¾ of their legal work in 2018. <br>

Companies’ in-house legal departments are increasingly reducing their legal spend and in-sourcing legal work, aided by technology. <br>

# Cost Pressures on Law Firms <br>
**COMPETITION FROM ALSPS** <br>
For cost-efficiency, in-house legal departments are also increasingly outsourcing work to alternative legal service providers (ALSPs). <br>
This will increase cost pressures on law firms as clients grow accustomed to paying lower fees for high-volume, basic legal services. <br>
60% of in-house departments in the U.K. and U.S. used ALSPs for at least one type of legal service in 2019. <br>

# Bifurcation of the Global Economy <br>
**GLOBAL FLUX** <br>
If countries around the world split into U.S.- and Chinese-led blocs, the affiliation of law firms will have larger consequences. Should either economic bloc lose ground in the other, law firms face significant readjustment in legal markets as new market leaders emerge. <br>
 
**ADAPTING TO THE DIVIDE**<br>
Firms which want to serve both markets may have to change their operations systems, such as having to maintain separate localised databases for the two blocs. Meanwhile, law firms in neutral countries could have opportunities in serving as a crucial bridge between the two.<br>

> “In addition to trade restrictions, cross-border data flows may face data localisation measures as well. This nationalistic trend has started and will escalate in the next one to four years. We must act now.” - Rajesh Sreenivasan, Head (Technology, Media & Telecommunications), Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP
